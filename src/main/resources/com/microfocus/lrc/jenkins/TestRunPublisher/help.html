    <p>Thresholds can help you find abnormal builds more quickly. Enter an integer from 0-100 to customize your thresholds.</p>

        Improvement denotes a decrease in the Transaction Response Time (TRT). For example, if the threshold is 5, all TRTs that show a decrease of 5% or more are colored <span style="color: #008000;">green</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, minor and major regressions denote an increase in the TRT. All TRTs that show a percentage increase of the configured threshold (or more) are colored <span style="color: #a8a800;">yellow (minor)</span> or <span
            style="color: #9b0000;">red (major)</span>.
